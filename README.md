Automation/Monitoring Kit

This is code for Automation Portal that executes jobs by Systems Center Orchestrator
This can be hooked to perform automation/recovery actions from custom monitoring  scripts and Systems Center Operations Mamager
The powershell scrripts are for monitors and automated actions required by alerts.
Finally the product can hook to AD and SCCM and pull patch schedules and force SCCM actions.
